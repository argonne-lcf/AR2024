# ALCF Student Summer Program
Every summer, the ALCF opens its doors to a new class of student researchers who work alongside staff mentors to tackle research projects that address issues at the forefront of scientific computing. In 2023, facility hosted more than 40 students ranging from high school seniors to Ph.D. candidates. Studying topics such as exploring scientific data in virtual reality, advancing X-ray imaging of brain tissue, and improving application memory performance, the interns had the opportunity to gain hands-on experience with some of the most advanced computing technologies in the world. For a recap of the 2023 program, [read the article on our website.](https://www.alcf.anl.gov/news/summer-interns-gain-hands-experience-argonne-supercomputers)

# CodeGirls@Argonne Camp
The annual [CodeGirls@Argonne Camp](https://www.anl.gov/education/codegirlsargonne-camp) hosts sixth- and seventh-grade girls each summer for a five-day event dedicated to teaching them the fundamentals of coding. Taught by Argonne computing researchers and staff from the lab’s Learning Center, the in-person camp gave students an opportunity to try out creative and computational thinking through activities that include programming robots. The camp also allowed participants to meet women scientists, who use code to solve problems, and take part in a tour of the ALCF’s machine room and visualization lab.

# Coding for Science Camp
In July, Argonne hosted its annual [Coding for Science Camp](https://www.anl.gov/education/coding-for-science-camp) for 30 high school freshmen and sophomores who were new to coding. The week-long camp, a joint initiative of Argonne’s Educational Programs Office and the ALCF, promotes problem solving and teamwork skills through hands-on coding activities, such as coding with Python and programming a robot, and interactions with Argonne staff members working in HPC and visualization.

# CSEdWeek/Hour of Code
As part of the national [Computer Science Education Week (CSEdWeek)](https://www.csedweek.org/) and the Hour of Code in December, ALCF staff members provide virtual talks and demos to Chicago area schools to spark interest in computer science. Working with students in classes from elementary to high school, the volunteers led a variety of activities designed to teach the basics of coding. CSEdWeek was established by Congress in 2009 to raise awareness about the need to elevate computer science education at all levels.

# Introduce a Girl to Engineering Day  
ALCF staff members regularly serve as mentors and volunteers for [Argonne’s Introduce a Girl to Engineering Day (IGED)](https://www.anl.gov/introduce-a-girl-to-engineering-day) program. The annual event gives eighth-grade students a unique opportunity to discover engineering careers alongside Argonne’s world-class scientists and engineers. Participants hear motivational presentations by Argonne engineers, tour the lab’s cutting-edge research facilities, connect with mentors, engage in hands-on engineering experiments, and compete in a team challenge.

# OneAPI Academic Hands-on Workshop
In October, nearly 100 undergraduate students from Chicagoland universities attended an all-day Intel oneAPI workshop hosted at Loyola University. Students had the opportunity to network with peers from other schools, professors, and experts from the ALCF. One highlight from the event was a graduate student panel, during which students had the opportunity to ask panelists about their work and paths to HPC.

# Science Careers in Search of Women
ALCF staff members continued to contribute to Argonne’s annual [Science Careers in Search of Women (SCSW)](https://www.anl.gov/science-careers-in-search-of-women) conference. The event hosts female high school students for a day of inspiring lectures, facility tours, career booth exhibits, and mentoring. SCSW provides participants with the unique experience to explore their desired profession or area of interest through interaction with Argonne’s women scientists and engineers.
