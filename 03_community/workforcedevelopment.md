Scientific breakthroughs in HPC and AI are driven by the ingenuity and expertise of the people who design, optimize, and support these powerful technologies. At the ALCF, computational scientists, software engineers, HPC system administrators, and research support staff work to maximize the capabilities of the facility’s HPC and AI resources, ensuring they can drive scientific discoveries across a wide range of disciplines. These efforts include collaborating with ALCF users to help maximize their computing time and research outcomes; deploying and maintaining cutting-edge HPC and AI systems for peak scientific performance; optimizing codes for ALCF resources; advancing open-source software; and developing tools and services to enhance data management, workflows, and computational efficiency.

Attracting and training the next generation of computing professionals is crucial to sustaining innovation in the use of HPC and AI for scientific research. The ALCF is committed to expanding the HPC and AI talent pipeline by engaging with students, educators, and researchers through a variety of outreach, training, and internship programs.


## Student Outreach

The ALCF is actively working to inspire future computer scientists through its contributions to educational programs that introduce students to coding, computational thinking, and scientific research. Each December, ALCF staff volunteer in Chicagoland schools for the Hour of Code initiative, a global effort to teach students to the basics of programming and broaden participation in computer science. The facility also engages students through programs like CodeGirls@Argonne Camp, which encourages them to explore coding, and annual outreach events such as Introduce a Girl to Engineering Day and Science Careers in Search of Women, where they connect with Argonne researchers and learn about careers in STEM.

For high school students, the ALCF contributes to immersive learning experiences that introduce them to computational science and data-driven research. Argonne’s annual Coding for Science Camp and Big Data Camp provide hands-on training in programming, data science, and problem-solving techniques used in scientific research. Additionally, ALCF staff mentor students participating in the ACT-SO (Afro-Academic, Cultural, Technological & Scientific Olympics) High School Research Program, guiding them through independent research projects that use Argonne’s computing resources.


## Hands-On Training and Career Development

At the college level, the ALCF provides hands-on learning experiences through its annual summer student program. Through programs like DOE’s Science Undergraduate Laboratory Internship (SULI) and Argonne’s research aide appointments, undergraduate and graduate students have the opportunity to work alongside ALCF staff mentors on real-world research projects in areas such as HPC system administration, data analytics, computational science, and AI-driven workflows.

Beyond summer internships, the ALCF extends its educational outreach with training opportunities throughout the year. One such program is the annual "Intro to AI-driven Science on Supercomputers" training series, which provides undergraduate and graduate students with an introduction to AI and supercomputing for scientific research. Launched in 2021, the virtual series has successfully reached over 700 participants from across the nation.

For those seeking more advanced training, the facility also hosts the Argonne Training Program on Extreme-Scale Computing (ATPESC), an intensive, two-week program that teaches attendees the key skills and tools needed to use the world’s powerful supercomputers. Since its launch in 2013, ATPESC has trained more than 800 participants, equipping them with knowledge in areas such as programming methodologies, numerical algorithms, HPC architectures, scientific machine learning, and data analysis. The program has been a pivotal experience for many attendees, helping them build valuable connections and advance their careers in computational science.

In 2024, the ALCF launched the Lighthouse Initiative, a program designed to establish long-term partnerships with academic institutions. This initiative aims to broaden the facility’s user base while fostering connections with the next generation of computing professionals. As part of its workforce development efforts, the ALCF offers internship opportunities to students from partner institutions, providing them with hands-on experience in scientific computing.


## Recruitment and Community Engagement

To connect with new talent and share career opportunities, the ALCF maintains a presence at major computing conferences and industry events. Staff members engage with students and professionals at events such as SC (Supercomputing), the Grace Hopper Celebration, and computing workshops to highlight the impact of HPC in advancing research and innovation.

The ALCF also supports efforts to build a stronger professional network for women in HPC. In collaboration with the University of Illinois Chicago, the facility helped establish Chicago Women in High Performance Computing (WHPC), a chapter dedicated to broadening participation in the field. The group provides mentorship, resources, and networking opportunities to support members pursuing careers in HPC.

Through these outreach and engagement efforts, the ALCF is working to grow the community of researchers and professionals who use and develop HPC and AI technologies, ensuring that these fields continue to evolve and drive scientific breakthroughs.
