# ALCF-4: Planning for Argonne’s Next-Generation Exascale System

Looking beyond Aurora, the facility also kicked off the ALCF-4 effort to prepare for its next-generation supercomputer. In April 2023, DOE approved Critical Decision-0 (CD-0), which is the first step in procuring a new system.  

Led by Jini Ramprakash, ALCF-4 Project Director, and Kevin Harms, ALCF-4 Technical Director, the team is targeting 2028–2029 for the deployment of the facility’s next production supercomputer. The project’s goals include enabling a significant improvement in application performance over Aurora, continuing to support traditional HPC workloads alongside AI and data-intensive computations, and investigating the potential to accelerate the deployment and realization of new technologies.
