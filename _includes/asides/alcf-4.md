# ALCF-4: Planning for Argonne’s Next-Generation Supercomputer

Looking beyond Aurora, the ALCF continued the efforts to prepare for its next-generation leadership supercomputer. Known as ALCF-4, the project released the draft technical specifications for the system in June 2024, soliciting comments and questions from the HPC community and potential vendors. They will use this input to prepare the request for proposals, which will be issued in 2025.

The ALCF-4 team is targeting 2028–2029 for the deployment of the facility’s next production system. The project’s goals include enabling a significant improvement in application performance over Aurora, continuing to support traditional HPC workloads alongside AI and data-intensive computations, and investigating the potential to accelerate the deployment and realization of new technologies.
