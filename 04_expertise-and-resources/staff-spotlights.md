## Riccardo Balin, Assistant Computational Scientist

Riccardo Balin joined the ALCF in 2021 as a postdoc under the Aurora Early Science Program (ESP) working on methods to incorporate machine learning with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and turbulence modeling simulations. In 2024, he joined the Data Services and Workflows team as an assistant computational scientist. In this role, Riccardo works with ALCF users on developing, scaling and applying novel workflows which aim to accelerate traditional simulations with AI methods. He also works closely with HPC vendors, ensuring the necessary software tools as well as new innovative solutions are available to our users.
 
In the last year, Riccardo continued his involvement in the Aurora ESP project aimed at developing ML-based closure models from ongoing simulations of turbulent aerodynamic flows. Thanks to his efforts, the project demonstrated INCITE readiness on the new Aurora supercomputer. Additionally, Riccardo spearheaded an Argonne led effort to incorporate AI methods into the nekRS CFD code called nekRS-ML. This collaboration now includes researchers from four divisions at Argonne and led to a new ALCC proposal for an AI-powered toolkit to accelerate simulation-based design space exploration. Riccardo also fostered new collaborations spanning across DOE labs to develop benchmarks for coupled simulation and AI workflows in order to better understand how these workloads can take full advantage of current and future HPC systems.
