## Riccardo Balin, Assistant Computational Scientist

Riccardo Balin joined the ALCF in 2021 as a postdoc under the Aurora Early Science Program (ESP) to work on methods to incorporate machine learning with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and turbulence modeling simulations. In 2024 he joined the Data Services and Workflows team as an Assistant Computational Scientist. In this role, Riccardo works with ALCF users on developing, scaling, and applying novel workflows which aim to accelerate traditional simulations with AI methods. He also works closely with HPC vendors, ensuring the necessary software tools as well as new innovative solutions are available to our users.
 
In the last year, Riccardo continued his involvement in an Aurora ESP project aimed at developing machine learning-based closure models from ongoing simulations of turbulent aerodynamic flows. Thanks to his efforts, the project demonstrated INCITE readiness on the Aurora supercomputer. Additionally, Riccardo has spearheaded an Argonne-led effort to incorporate AI methods into the nekRS CFD code called nekRS-ML. This collaboration now includes researchers from four divisions at Argonne and led to a new ALCC proposal for an AI-powered toolkit to accelerate simulation-based design space exploration. Riccardo has also fostered new collaborations spanning across DOE labs to develop benchmarks for coupled simulation and AI workflows in order to better understand how these workloads can take full advantage of current and future HPC systems.

In 2024, Varuni joined the AuroraGPT pre-training team, setting up the data processing pipeline and developing several key features for distributed training framework for scalable language and vision models. Varuni contributed to three different Gordon Bell submissions for 2024, and the “MProt-DPO” work on multimodal protein design workflow was selected as a Gordon Bell finalist. She was awarded an Impact Argonne Award for the Enhancement of Argonne's Reputation for her contribution. She was also honored with an Impact Argonne Award for Extraordinary Efforts for her contribution to “AuroraGlimmer,” a project aiming to build a scalable pipeline for the AuroraGPT project. In collaboration with teams from Argonne's Center for Nanoscale Materials and Advanced Photon Source, she developed a large language model-based chat framework incorporating retrieval-augmented generation and tailored for scientific facilities, published in _npj Computational Materials_.

As part of outreach activities, Varuni co-organized several tutorial and workshops on AI Testbeds including sessions at SuperComputing’24, Argonne Training Program on Extreme-Scale Computing (ATPESC) and other ALCF events. She also delivered an invited talk at NNSA Emergent Technology Seminar. In addition, she co-organized INCITE GPU hackathon and served as a reviewer for both ATPESC’24 and INCITE’25 committees.


## Christine Simpson, Assistant Computational Scientist

Christine Simpson joined the ALCF in 2022 as an Assistant Computational Scientist in the Data Science group. Now part of the Data Services and Workflows group, she primarily focuses on workflows on ALCF systems, which involves development and testing of workflow tools and user support and training. She is currently the lead developer for Balsam, an ALCF-developed workflow package that has enabled users to deploy high-throughput workflows on ALCF systems. She also works closely with the Parsl and Globus teams to help optimize their tools and services for ALCF users.

In the past year, Christine has been heavily involved in ALCF efforts relating to Integrated Research Infrastructure (IRI), an initiative to interconnect DOE experimental and computational facilities. She has been the ALCF point person in a collaboration with the DIII-D National Fusion Facility and NERSC, and led efforts to run a production IRI workflow on the ALCF's Polaris supercomputer to analyze the dynamics of neutral beams within the DIII-D tokamak during its fall campaign. A demonstration was performed at the 2024 Supercomputing Conference wherein Polaris analyzed live DIII-D experiments concurrent with an IRI workflow at NERSC. In addition to DIII-D effots, Christine works with a number of other IRI users to analyze data on ALCF systems.

Christine has also worked on exploring new approaches for coupling simulation and AI/ML codes on ALCF systems. She has co-led efforts to explore a new workflow and data management tool called Dragon developed by HPE.

## Sheeja Susan, Software Development Specialist

Sheeja Susan joined the ALCF in 2019 as a Software Development Specialist under the Advanced Integration Group. She was a contractor for 5 years and became a full-time employee in 2024.

At Argonne, Sheeja is responsible for developing and maintaining frontend screens within the ALCF portal and Allocation Request Management websites. She also creates test automation scripts to ensure the website pages run correctly, and was part of the team that managed migration from AngularJS to Angular in ALCF scripts. She has developed ALCF screens such as the Director's Discretionary Allocation Request and View Systems pages—along with many others for administrators—and helped implement the page routing. She works closely with UX/design teams and effectively translates design concepts into functional webpages. Coordinating with the backend team, Sheeja creates modular, reusable code components for the development of user-friendly, responsive pages across various screen sizes. She has written numerous test scripts in Cypress to test the functionality of webpages and helped to reduce significantly the number of failing ALCF test scripts.

Much of Sheeja's work in 2024 revolved around the frontend development of Allocation Request Management (ARM) website and the new version of the Director's Discretionary Allocation Request form (DD Allocation Request form). The ALCF Allocations Committee reviews requests from the DD Allocation Request form through the ARM site. The ARM site is the internal clearinghouse for ALCF staff to view, analyze, and ultimately approve allocation requests. Within the site, the Committee reviews a project's goals and discerns whether the project fits with the ALCF resources and mission. Sheeja also participated in the ALCF portal development to replace the UB3 home page and login section with that of portal, to create functionalities for the redirection of UB3-specific URLs from email links, and to modify the UB3 menu with the same look and feel of the portal menu. Lastly, she was also able to successfully implement Angular Route Guards to activate and deactivate the navigation to specific routes in ALCF.
