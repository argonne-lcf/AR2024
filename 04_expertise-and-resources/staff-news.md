# ALCF Team Awarded Most Outstanding Paper at 2023 IWOCL & SYCLcon

ALCF researchers authored a study that was recognized as the [Most Outstanding Paper at the 2023 IWOCL & SYCLcon conference](https://www.alcf.anl.gov/news/simplifying-use-complex-numbers-sycl). Led by ALCF’s Thomas Applencourt, the team included ALCF colleagues Kevin Harms, Brice Videau, and Nevin Liber, as well as Bryce Allen of Argonne/University of Chicago, Amanda Dufek of NERSC, and Jefferson le Quellec and Aiden Belton-Schure of Codeplay. The team’s paper, “[Standardizing complex numbers in SYCL](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3585341.3585343),” provides an open-source library of complex numbers and associated math functions that can be used in computations carried out with SYCL, a key programming framework for next-generation supercomputers, including the ALCF’s Aurora exascale system.

# Papka Receives Distinguished Performance Award

ALCF Director Michael Papka received the [Distinguished Performance Award](https://www.alcf.anl.gov/news/alcfs-michael-e-papka-honored-distinguished-performance-award) at the Argonne Board of Governors’ awards ceremony in September. Papka was recognized for his numerous exemplary contributions to Argonne, including his efforts to help build world-class scientific computing capabilities for open science.

# ALCF-SWIFT Collaboration Recognized with Argonne Delivering Impact Award

As part of Argonne National Laboratory's 2023 Commercialization Excellence Awards, ALCF researchers Venkatram Vishwanath, Michael Papka, William Allcock, and Filippo Simini were recognized with a [Delivering Impact Award for their collaboration with SWIFT](https://www.alcf.anl.gov/news/alcf-researchers-receive-argonne-commercialization-excellence-award-swift-collaboration), a global provider of financial messaging services. The collaborative effort leveraged ALCF’s supercomputing and AI resources to explore SWIFT’s synthetic transactional data streams and identify patterns, including any anomalous activity. The pattern-detection methods developed by the ALCF team provided SWIFT with the capabilities to respond to anomalies more rapidly, thereby strengthening financial infrastructure.

# ALCF Contributes to IEEE eScience Best Paper Award
ALCF’s Venkat Vishwanath was part of a multi-institutional team that won a [Best Paper Award at the 19th IEEE International Conference on eScience](https://www.alcf.anl.gov/news/research-coauthored-alcf-and-olcf-staff-receives-ieee-escience-best-paper-award). The team, which included Romain Egele of Argonne, Prasanna Balaprakash of Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and Isabelle Guyon of Google, was recognized for “[Asynchronous Decentralized Bayesian Optimization for Large Scale Hyperparameter Optimization](https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings-article/e-science/2023/10254839/1QJggWpUblK).” The researchers used the ALCF’s Polaris supercomputer to aid in the development of a new, overhead-reducing approach to Bayesian optimization — a technique for optimizing the hyperparameters of deep neural networks.

# ALCF Team Wins First Place and Best Workflow at 2023 IEEE SciVis Contest

An ALCF team won [first place and best workflow at the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers’ (IEEE) 2023 SciVis Contest](https://www.alcf.anl.gov/news/alcf-team-wins-first-place-and-best-workflow-2023-ieee-scivis-contest) for their development of a multi-platform scientific visualization application for analyzing data from brain plasticity simulations. Led by Tommy Marrinan of the ALCF and the University of St. Thomas, the team included ALCF colleagues Victor Mateevitsi and Michael Papka, and University of St. Thomas students Madeleine Moeller and Alina Kanayinkal. Their paper, “VisAnywhere: Developing Multi-platform Scientific Visualization Applications,” demonstrated how a single codebase can be adapted to develop visualization applications that run on a variety of display technologies, including mobile devices, laptops, high-resolution display walls, and virtual reality headsets. 

# Balin Receives Argonne Postdoctoral Performance Award

Riccardo Balin, a postdoctoral researcher at the ALCF, received a [Postdoctoral Performance Award](https://www.alcf.anl.gov/news/10-researchers-receive-argonne-postdoctoral-performance-awards) at Argonne National Laboratory's Postdoctoral Research and Career Symposium in November. Balin was recognized for his innovative work in coupling high-fidelity aerodynamic flow simulations with machine learning to improve modeling capabilities for aerospace engineering.

# ALCF Team Receives Best Paper Award at ISAV 2023 Workshop

An ALCF-led team was recognized with the [Best Paper Award at the 2023 In Situ Infrastructures for Enabling Extreme-scale Analysis and Visualization (ISAV) Workshop](https://www.alcf.anl.gov/news/alcf-team-wins-best-paper-award-isav-2023-workshop) at the SC23 conference. Led by ALCF’s Victor Mateevitsi, the team included ALCF colleagues Joseph Insley, Michael Papka, Saumil Patel, and Silvio Rizzi; Nicola Ferrier, Paul Fischer, Yu-Hsiang Lan, and Misun Min of Argonne; and Mathis Bode, Jens Henrik Göbbert, and Jonathan Windgassen of the Jülich Supercomputing Centre (JSC) in Germany. Their paper, “[Scaling Computational Fluid Dynamics: In Situ Visualization of NekRS using SENSEI](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3624062.3624159),” detailed efforts to equip the NekRS computational fluid dynamics code with in situ analysis and visualization capabilities. 

# Argonne Team Receives Best Paper at XLOOP 2023 Workshop

ALCF's Benoit Côté was part of an Argonne team awarded [Best Paper at the annual Workshop on Extreme-Scale Experiment-in-the-Loop Computing (XLOOP)](https://www.alcf.anl.gov/news/argonne-team-demonstrates-rapid-cross-facility-data-processing) at the SC23 conference. The team, which also included Argonne's Michael Prince, Doğa Gürsoy, Dina Sheyfer, Ryan Chard, Hannah Paraga, Barbara Frosik, Jon Tischler and Nicholas Schwarz, was recognized for their paper, "[Demonstrating Cross-Facility Data Processing at Scale With Laue Microdiffraction](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3624062.3624613)." Using a fully automated pipeline between the ALCF and Argonne's Advanced Photon Source, the team leveraged ALCF's Polaris supercomputer to reconstruct data obtained from a Laue microdiffraction experiment, returning reconstructed scans to the APS within 15 minutes.
