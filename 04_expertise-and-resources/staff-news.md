## ALCF Team Receives Best Paper Award at ISAV 2024

A team including ALCF researchers received the [Best Paper Award](https://www.alcf.anl.gov/news/alcf-teams-receive-best-paper-awards-sc24-workshops) at the SC24 conference’s In Situ Infrastructures for Enabling Extreme-Scale Analysis and Visualization (ISAV 2024) Workshop. The paper, “[Bridging Gaps in Simulation Analysis through a General Purpose, Bidirectional Steering Interface with Ascent](https://doi.org/10.1109/SCW63240.2024.00119),” was authored by Argonne’s Victor Mateevitsi, Silvio Rizzi, Joseph Insley, Michael Papka, Thomas Marrinan, and Dimitrios Fytanidis, along with Utah State University’s Andres Sewell and Steve Petruzza, and Cyrus Harrison and Nicole Marsaglia of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Sewell, the lead author, has been a summer student at the ALCF for the past two years. The paper introduces a framework for adding interactive, human-in-the-loop steering controls to existing simulation codes. This capability allows scientists to pause, adjust, and resume large-scale simulations without starting over.

## ALCF-Led Team Receives Best Paper Award at PMBS24

A team of researchers led by ALCF staff received the [Best Paper Award](https://www.alcf.anl.gov/news/alcf-teams-receive-best-paper-awards-sc24-workshops) at SC24’s Performance Modeling, Benchmarking and Simulation of High Performance Computer Systems (PMBS24) Workshop. The paper, “[Ponte Vecchio Across the Atlantic: Single-Node Benchmarking of Two Intel GPU Systems](https://doi.org/10.1109/SCW63240.2024.00184),” provides micro-benchmarking data from applications running on the ALCF’s Aurora supercomputer and another Intel GPU-powered system, housed at the University of Cambridge. Argonne’s Thomas Applencourt, Servesh Muralidharan, Colleen Bertoni, JaeHyuk Kwack, Ye Luo, Esteban Rangel, John Tramm, and Yasaman Ghadar authored the paper in collaboration with University of Bristol’s Aditya Sadawarte and Tom Deakin, and University of Cambridge’s Christopher Edsall.


## Research Team Utilizing ALCF Resources Wins HPCwire Editors’ Choice Award for Best Use of HPC in Physical Sciences

A team with researchers from Argonne National Laboratory, as well as University of Chicago, University of Illinois-Urbana Champaign, National Center for Supercomputing Applications, and University of Minnesota, received the [HPCwire Editors’ Choice Award for Best Use of HPC in Physical Sciences](https://www.hpcwire.com/2024-readers-editors-choice-best-use-of-hpc-in-physical-sciences/) for work utilizing ALCF resources including the Polaris supercomputer and the Globus data management platform. This work was aimed at developing a physics-informed transformer model to predict gravitational wave evolution for spinning binary black hole mergers. The team’s AI approach dramatically reduces simulation time from days to seconds, handling terabyte-scale datasets with high accuracy.

## ALCF-APS Pipeline Honored with HPCwire Readers’ Choice Award

An automated pipeline integrating ALCF supercomputers and Advanced Photon Source instruments to enable near-real-time data analysis was named the [Best HPC in the Cloud Use Case](https://www.hpcwire.com/2024-readers-editors-choice-best-use-of-hpc-in-the-cloud-use-case/), winning an HPCwire Readers’ Choice Award. The pipeline allows scientists to adjust experiments on the fly, potentially accelerating scientific breakthroughs by delivering rapid results while researchers still have facility access.


## Aurora Honored with HPCwire Readers’ Choice Award for Top Supercomputing Achievement

The ALCF’s Aurora supercomputer was named the recipient of the [Readers’ Choice Award for Top Supercomputing Achievement](https://www.hpcwire.com/2024-readers-editors-choice-top-supercomputing-achievement/) at HPCwire 2024. The supercomputer was recognized for demonstrating how effectively AI can be implemented in high-performance computing to accelerate scientific breakthroughs across disciplines, including neuroscience, particle physics, and drug discovery.

## Argonne Collaboration Wins HPCwire Readers’ Choice Award for Best Use of High Performance Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence

Argonne National Laboratory and Dow Inc. received the [HPCwire Readers’ Choice Award for Best Use of High Performance Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence](https://www.hpcwire.com/2024-readers-editors-choice-best-use-of-high-performance-data-analytics-ai/) for their collaborative development of a framework that combines computational fluid dynamics and an active machine learning optimizer for efficient turbulent jet mixer design. The novel approach developed optimizes jet-mixing technology, potentially reducing reliability issues and costs associated with traditional agitators, with estimated savings of up to $6.1 million per year per plant.
