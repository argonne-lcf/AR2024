## ALCF Researchers Contribute to Gordon Bell Prize Finalist Study

An Argonne-led team was selected as a finalist for the 2024 ACM Gordon Bell Prize for their work to develop MProt-DPO, an [AI-driven protein design framework](https://www.alcf.anl.gov/news/argonne-team-breaks-new-ground-ai-driven-protein-design). The team’s study, ["MProt-DPO: Breaking the ExaFLOPS Barrier for Multimodal Protein Design Workflows with Direct Preference Optimization,”](https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings-article/sc/2024/529100a074/21HUV88n1F6) leveraged five of the world’s leading HPC systems, including the ALCF’s Aurora exascale supercomputer, to develop and demonstrate a scalable, end-to-end workflow for accelerating the discovery of new proteins for medicine, catalysis, and other applications. The team includes Argonne researchers Gautham Dharuman, Kyle Hippe, Alexander Brace, Sam Foreman, Väinö Hatanpää, Varuni Sastry, Huihuo Zheng, Logan Ward, Servesh Muralidharan, Archit Vasan, Bharat Kale, Carla Mann, Heng Ma, Murali Emani, Michael Papka, Ian Foster, Rick Stevens, and Venkatram Vishwanath. Additional contributors include Yun-Hsuan Cheng, Yuliana Zamora, and Tom Gibbs (NVIDIA); Shengchao Liu (University of California, Berkeley); Chaowei Xiao (University of Wisconsin-Madison); Mahidhar Tatineni (San Diego Supercomputing Center); and Deepak Canchi, Jerome Mitchell, Koichi Yamada, and Maria Garzaran (Intel). 

## ALCF Team Receives Best Paper Award at ISAV 2024

A team including ALCF researchers received the [Best Paper Award](https://www.alcf.anl.gov/news/alcf-teams-receive-best-paper-awards-sc24-workshops) at the SC24 conference’s In Situ Infrastructures for Enabling Extreme-Scale Analysis and Visualization (ISAV 2024) Workshop. The paper, “[Bridging Gaps in Simulation Analysis through a General Purpose, Bidirectional Steering Interface with Ascent](https://doi.org/10.1109/SCW63240.2024.00119),” was authored by Argonne’s Victor Mateevitsi, Silvio Rizzi, Joseph Insley, Michael Papka, Thomas Marrinan, and Dimitrios Fytanidis, along with Utah State University’s Andres Sewell and Steve Petruzza, and Cyrus Harrison and Nicole Marsaglia of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Sewell, the lead author, has been a summer student at the ALCF for the past two years. The paper introduces a framework for adding interactive, human-in-the-loop steering controls to existing simulation codes. This capability allows scientists to pause, adjust, and resume large-scale simulations without starting over.

## Papka Named UIC Warren S. McCulloch Professor of Computer Science, Director of Electronic Visualization Laboratory

ALCF Director Michael Papka was named the [Warren S. McCulloch Professor of Computer Science](https://cs.uic.edu/news-stories/cs-establishes-the-warren-s-mcculloch-collegiate-professorships-of-computer-science/) at the University of Illinois Chicago, an endowed professorship recognizing leadership and impact in the field while supporting continued research and teaching. In addition to this honor, Papka was also appointed [director of UIC’s Electronic Visualization Laboratory (EVL)](https://cs.uic.edu/news-stories/michael-e-papka-named-director-of-uics-electronic-visualization-laboratory/), an interdisciplinary research space focused on collaborative visualization, virtual reality, and advanced computing and networking infrastructure.

## ECP Team Earns DOE Secretary of Energy Achievement Award

The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) recognized the Exascale Computing Project (ECP) with the Secretary of Energy Honor Achievement Award for its role in delivering an exascale computing ecosystem for the nation. The multi-lab collaboration involved several key staff from Argonne, including Lois Curfman McInnes, David Martin, Susan Coghlan, Todd Munson, and Yasaman Ghadar, who were on hand to receive the award as part of the ECP leadership team.
