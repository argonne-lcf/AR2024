title: Accessing ALCF Resources for Science
intro: "As a national user facility dedicated to open science, any researcher in the world with a large-scale computing problem can apply for time on ALCF computing resources."

Researchers gain access to ALCF systems for computational science and engineering projects through competitive, peer-reviewed allocation programs supported by the DOE and Argonne.

The ALCF also hosts competitive, peer-reviewed application programs designed to prepare key scientific applications and innovative computational methods for the architecture and scale of DOE supercomputers.

# Allocation Programs


## INCITE
The Innovative Novel Computational Impact on Theory and Experiment (INCITE) program aims to accelerate scientific discoveries and technological innovations by awarding ALCF computing time and resources to large-scale, computationally intensive projects that address grand challenges in science and engineering.

## ALCC
The ASCR Leadership Computing Challenge (ALCC) program allocates ALCF computing resources to projects that advance the DOE mission; help to broaden the community of researchers capable of using leadership computing resources; and serve the national interests for scientific discovery, technological innovation, and economic competitiveness.

## Director's Discretionary
Directorâ€™s Discretionary projects are dedicated to leadership computing preparation, INCITE and ALCC scaling, and efforts to maximize scientific application efficiency and productivity on leadership computing platforms.

## ESP
As part of the process of bringing a new supercomputer into production, the ALCF conducts its Early Science Program (ESP) to prepare applications for the architecture and scale of a new system. ESP projects represent a typical system workload at the ALCF and cover key scientific areas and numerical methods.
