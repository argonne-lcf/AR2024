Run in spring and fall of 2024, the “Intro to AI-driven Science on Supercomputers” is an ALCF organized virtual training series aimed at undergraduate and graduate students. Drawing on Argonne’s extensive AI expertise and computing capabilities, the series is designed around AI training and works to equip a new generation of researchers with the knowledge and skills needed to harness the power of AI and high-performance computing (HPC) for scientific discoveries and innovations.

This year’s series focused on understanding the fundamentals of large-language models (LLMs) and their scientific applications.

The series is comprised of a variety of virtual sessions that give attendees hands-on experience running AI models on ALCF supercomputers and AI accelerators. This included hands on time on Polaris as well as the AI Testbeds machines. Led by Argonne experts, the sessions covered topics such as large language models and LLM prompt engineering, neural networks, parallel training methods for AI, and an overview of novel AI accelerators which featured the systems housed at the ALCF AI Testbed.   

Each session is followed by a science-focused talk that highlights how different Argonne teams are using AI for research in fields such as biosciences, climate and cosmology. To extend the program’s reach, videos of each session are available on  YouTube and session materials are available on GitHub.

In this session, ALCF’s Archit Vasan shows attendees how computer models generate and comprehend natural language. The session covers the architecture of large language models, input tokenization, and practical applications. Following Vasan’s presentation, Argonne’s Nicola Ferrier discusses AI @ Edge, sharing several ways in which AI is being pushed out to remote locations where data can be collected, analyzed, and used in real-time.

In this session, ALCF’s Marieme Ngom teaches attendees the basics of neural networks, opening the black box of machine learning by building out by-hand networks for linear regression to increase the understanding of the math that goes into machine learning methods. Following her talk, Argonne’s Nina Andrejevic gives a talk covering how to advance materials characterization through physics-guided machine learning.

In this session, ALCF’s Siddhisanket Raskar presents current advances in AI hardware and the ALCF AI Testbed that is being integrated with existing and upcoming supercomputers at the facility to accelerate science insights. Raskar also provides a brief overview of getting started on each AI Testbed including Cerebras, 
Graphcore, SambaNova, and Groq. 

Attendees who complete all in-class and post-class exercises by the end of the series receive a certificate of completion and a digital badge.
