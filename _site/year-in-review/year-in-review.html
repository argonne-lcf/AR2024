<h2 id="bill-allcock-alcf-director-of-operations">Bill Allcock, ALCF Director of Operations</h2>

<p>For the operations team, and much of ALCF, 2024 was the year of Aurora. It was the single largest effort, involving every aspect of the team, and culminated in the completion of acceptance testing in December. This concluded an effort that spanned many years and while it was a challenge, I am proud of the operations team for the part they played in bringing Aurora to fruition.</p>

<p>Aurora brought many challenges. From the operations side, one of the challenges was managing the sheer volume of log and monitoring data. To address this, we created a “data lake” that ingests data into Parquet files and then incrementally improves and filters them. It also enables SQL-like queries against the files on disk. We are currently running this in parallel with the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, but we are likely going to shift to ingesting everything into the data lake and then having our Business Intelligence system perform ETL from there. Many of the AI frameworks have native support for the Parquet files, and this should be a valuable tool for AI researchers moving forward.</p>

<p>While Aurora sometimes felt like the whole of the ALCF universe, it certainly was not the only focus. Polaris, the ALCF’s primary production machine, had a very good year. Although the official numbers are not yet in, we exceeded all our performance metrics, some by a significant margin. Our Integrated Resource Infrastructure (IRI) work also continued apace. With the Advanced Photon Source coming up from their upgrade, we have begun doing production processing of beamline data and expanded the scope of this work to other facilities and science communities. As long-time users are undoubtedly aware, we typically have a weekly or bi-weekly cadence of regular preventative maintenance. To better support the IRI concept, we put significant effort into improving our systems and processes by adding redundancy, enabling maintenance while systems are live, and implementing other measures to minimize disruption. Our target was a maintenance cadence of four months, and we successfully accomplished that on Polaris. We completed a software upgrade on Aurora using an improved process, where the upgrade was treated much like a software development project. This involved using Sirius as the stage system, making all changes and conducting all testing there, before pushing them up to Aurora. It went well, but there is also room for improvement, and we will continue refining this process.</p>

<p>We also brought some new resources online this year. Crux, a CPU-only system originally developed as a testbed for evaluating system software for Aurora, was deployed to users late this year. It is small relative to other ALCF systems at about 1 PF, but it is a non-trivial resource and there is a small, but important, set of science applications that can take advantage of a CPU-only machine. Additionally, we deployed Sophia, a 24-node Nvidia A100 DGX system, in July. Previously part of ThetaGPU, Sophia became a standalone system after Theta’s retirement. It is targeted at smaller workloads that need near-immediate turnaround, such as Jupyter notebooks and interactive visualizations.</p>

<p>The ALCF AI Testbed did not add new systems in 2024, but several upgrades were implemented, and new systems are planned for next year. Resources were also made available to the National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource (NAIRR) pilot, and we supported multiple workshops and an SC24 tutorial.</p>

<p>On the storage front, the most significant change for users was that we enabled the ability for users to share their data on the Eagle and Grand storage systems by default. Users still must create shares, but they no longer need to explicitly request this capability be enabled. Another significant effort on the storage side, that was, by design, completely transparent to the users, was the migration of all data in the Grand filesystem path onto the same hardware as Eagle so we could repurpose the hardware to support Aurora during testing. This isolated the storage for Aurora from the rest of ALCF to avoid the ongoing changes disrupting other production resources. We also completed routine upgrades of the Lustre storage and HPSS.</p>

<p>We also released a significant upgrade to the ALCF account and project management website. Named myALCF, the new platform greatly expands web tools for ALCF users to manage their projects and resources. It offers a dashboard with real-time data graphs to show allocation usage, allocation on-track trends, daily/14-day/monthly job activity, and node usage through a project all at a glance. Additionally, myALCF includes a web tool to help new users learn our sbank accounting tool. The sbank tool also helps seasoned ALCF users to be aware of options in sbank that they may not have seen or used before. With myALCF, users still have all the functionality of the previous accounts and project management system (requesting allocation, managing projects and Unix groups, etc.) in a cleaner user interface. We plan to continue expanding myALCF with an improved cluster accounting (sbank) web presence, web UI for job management, and a user notification framework in the future.</p>

<p>Over the past year, our team made significant strides in advancing the ALCF-3 project, successfully facilitating the transition of the Aurora supercomputer into production. At the same time, we laid the groundwork for the ALCF-4 project, contributing extensively to the early stages of our next system acquisition.</p>

<p>The Aurora efforts were multifaceted, with our team collaborating closely with Intel on Non-Recurring Engineering (NRE) tasks for key software components, including those integrated within the oneAPI framework. Additionally, we focused on stabilizing and optimizing system performance by running a diverse array of workloads designed to stress-test Aurora, pinpointing performance bottlenecks and addressing system failures. In parallel, our team worked diligently to optimize and scale several science applications from the Aurora Early Science Program and the Exascale Computing Project. A major accomplishment was the preparation and execution of an extensive set of tests and applications that were essential for the functional, performance, and stability assessments during Aurora’s acceptance at the end of the year.</p>

<p>For the ALCF-4 project, the team played an instrument role in drafting several sections of the Request for Proposal (RFP), actively enaging in internal reviews, and visiting vendors to gain a deeper understanding of their roadmaps while effectively communicating the facility’s evolving needs.
Throughout the year, the team also made impressive contributions in showcasing Aurora’s extraordinary scientific capabilities. Notable achievements include:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Performance Engineering Excellence:</b> The performance engineering team partnered with Intel to run a comprehensive suite of benchmarks, including the High-Performance Linpack (HPL) benchmark for the TOP500 list and the mixed-precision variant (HPL MxP) to evaluate Aurora’s AI processing capabilities. The team also executed the Graph 500 benchmark, which evaluates large-scale data analytics performance, and the High-Performance Conjugate Gradient (HPCG) benchmark, which measures computational efficiency in scientific simulations. These results placed Aurora among the most powerful supercomputers in the world, establishing its place at the top of the global rankings.</li>
  <li><b>AI/ML Innovations:</b> The AI/ML team, in collaboration with other research groups, earned widespread recognition for their groundbreaking work in scaling and fine-tuning a large language model on Aurora. Their efforts were recognized as a finalist for Gordon Bell Prize, underscoring their significant contributions to advancing  AI and machine learning capabilities in supercomputing.</li>
  <li><b>Visualization and Data Analytics Milestone:</b> In partnership with Intel, the visualization and data analytics team ensured that Intel’s oneAPI Render Kit fully leveraged Aurora’s GPU ray-tracing cores. As a result, Aurora became the first supercomputer in the world to use GPU-accelerated ray tracing as its primary rendering method, pushing the boundaries of high-performance visualization and data analytics.</li>
  <li><b>Data Services and Workflows for Advanced AI:</b> The data services and workflows team continues to work at the forefront of developing scalable inference services to meet the growing demand for large language model prompting on ALCF systems. These services support a broad spectrum of applications, from querying complex scientific phenomena to protein sequence analysis and even code generation. The team’s innovative work has resulted in the creation of user-friendly web applications and robust programmable interfaces for both individual queries and large-batch prompt processing, further expanding the accessibility to cutting-edge AI capabilities.</li>
  <li><b>Commitment to Standards and User Empowerment:</b> The team remains actively engaged in various standards committees, advocating for the integration of new features into programming languages and models that are driven by ALCF user needs and the technical requirements of our systems. The team’s commitment to user empowerment is reflected in their ongoing development of comprehensive technical documentation and workshop presentations designed to educate and train the user community. Moreover, the team continues to evaluate emerging systems at Argonne’s Joint Laboratory for System Evaluation and the ALCF AI Testbed, ensuring the ALCF remains at the forefront of technological innovation in anticipation of future acquisitions.</li>

<p>In 2024, we ramped up our efforts to plan for the facility’s next-generation supercomputer via the ALCF-4 project. Even though our newest system, Aurora, is just getting started, it’s critical to lay the groundwork for future supercomputers well in advance. We formally launched the ALCF-4 effort in 2023 with a target deployment in the 2028–2029 timeframe. Over the past year, we’ve reached several key milestones: releasing the draft technical requirements in June, conducting a successful technical design review in August, and engaging with potential vendors to assess their technology roadmaps and timelines. The project will gain further momentum next year with major reviews, including Critical Decision-1 (CD-1), which evaluates the project’s technical approach, design, and implementation while establishing preliminary cost and schedule estimates.</p>

<p>Our work to plan for future computing resources also extended beyond ALCF-4. We contributed to a charge from the DOE Advanced Scientific Computing Advisory Committee (ASCAC) to develop a 10-year outlook for the DOE computing facilities. This effort culminated in a report outlining the investments and upgrades needed to ensure DOE remains at the forefront of scientific computing.</p>

<p>Workforce development has remained a priority as well. Our annual “Intro to AI” training series continues to provide hundreds of college students with hands-on experience in using AI and supercomputers for science. In addition to training, we offer students the opportunity to apply their skills in real research environments through various appointments and internships at the ALCF. This year, we partnered with the University of Illinois Chicago’s Sprintership program, welcoming five students for three-week internships at the ALCF in the spring—four of whom returned for summer internships to work in their areas of interest. These efforts are part of our broader vision to inspire the next generation of STEM professionals by providing opportunities to explore careers in computing.</p>

<p>In 2024, our user community once again pushed the boundaries of scientific computing, achieving breakthroughs in fields ranging from biology and materials science to cosmology and fusion energy. At the same time, we continued to see more and more projects with complex workflows that integrate simulation, data science, and AI methods, reflecting the growing convergence of these approaches in scientific computing. The year was marked by several high-impact projects, including a collaboration between DOE and NASA to perform simulations that are helping prepare for future observations of the cosmos, and the development of an innovative AI-driven protein design framework that was recognized as a finalist for the Gordon Bell Prize. We also made strides in integrating our supercomputing resources with experimental facilities to speed up data-intensive discoveries, while early science teams on Aurora had some promising pre-production results that hint at the transformative advances to come.</p>

<p>One of the year’s most exciting moments was seeing David Baker, a longtime ALCF user from the University of Washington, receive the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his pioneering work in computational protein design. Baker was among the first researchers to use ALCF systems nearly 20 years ago and has since led multiple INCITE projects aimed at designing novel proteins and peptides for medical and industrial applications.</p>

<p>While the Nobel Prize underscores the lasting impact of our community’s efforts, computational protein design represents just one area of the dynamic research portfolio supported by the ALCF. In 2024, we provided computing resources to 31 INCITE projects, 31 ALCC projects (spanning two award cycles), and numerous Director’s Discretionary projects. We also began supporting some of the initial projects awarded through the National AI Research Resource (NAIRR) pilot, providing them with access to the ALCF AI Testbed.</p>

<p>To kick off the year, a multi-institutional team from DOE, NASA, and academia used our now-retired Theta system for a final run before it was decommissioned. The team generated nearly 4 million images of the cosmos to help researchers prepare for upcoming observations from NASA’s Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope and the NSF-DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory. By publicly releasing the simulation data, they are enabling the scientific community to refine processing pipelines, improve analysis codes, and prepare to interpret real observations as soon as they start coming in.</p>

<p>This year also saw major progress toward building an Integrated Research Infrastructure (IRI), a DOE initiative designed to accelerate data-intensive science by connecting supercomputers with large-scale experimental and observational facilities. One of our key partners in this effort is the Advanced Photon Source (APS), a DOE user facility at Argonne. In a demonstration of IRI capabilities, the team used a fully automated pipeline between ALCF and APS to rapidly process data from an X-ray experiment. The researchers reconstructed the experimental data on Polaris and returned results to APS within 15 minutes, highlighting an approach for experiment-time data analysis that can be applied at other facilities.</p>

<p>We also saw some innovative work being carried out by early science team using pre-production time on Aurora. This included the Gordon Bell Prize finalist project that used Aurora and four other powerful supercomputers to develop an AI-driven framework for protein design. In December, another team ran a pair of cosmological simulations on Aurora to explore recent findings from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, which hint at new physics beyond the standard model of cosmology. While these early examples offer a preview of Aurora’s impact, we can’t wait to see the discoveries the system will enable when it is released to the broader scientific community next year.</p>
